# Flat Hue

This is a project I am creating to keep track of all the color schemes I use in the websites that I create. Also, I am using this as a quick reference guide to color schemes I might want to use in the future.

I am opening this up to the public in hopes someone finds this as useful as I do in visualizing different colors together without having to tab back and forth looking for colors that might work together.
