# Flat Hue

Flat Hue was created in order for front end developers like myself to be able to visualize different color schemes without having to alter their code multiple times trying out different color palettes. 

## **Goals**
1. Would like to generate colors on page load without having to click buttons
2. Would like to be able to click to copy hex code on each of the blocks generated

## **Contributors**
1. @mariamrf -- Provided random flat color generator function.
