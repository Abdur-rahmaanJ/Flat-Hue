# Flat Hue

This is a project that is intended to allow front end developers to brainstorm color options and get a visual reference to how those colors would work together without having to alter their own code.

I am opening this up to the public in hopes someone finds this as useful as I do in visualizing different colors together without having to tab back and forth looking for colors that might work together.
